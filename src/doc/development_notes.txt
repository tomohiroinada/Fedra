I send to you 5 files modifed in order to compile fedra with
both Visual Studio 6 (command: makeall) and  Visual Studio 7 (command:
makeall -vc7).

I have included also a little help in makefile.cmd and make.cmd
(makefile -?, make -?)

I have re-written the scripts in order to avoid illegal usage of the goto
instruction (used only in structured forms).

reg.exe is a system command in WinXP and Win2003Server. It doesn't work with
later version (a dedicated version exists in the Windows2000 Resource
ToolKit) so I skip the check on SySalDataIO when %WinDir%\System32\reg.exe
doesn't exist

Bug fixed by Luillo in EdbSeg3D::Transform


VT: 2/12/2003

Index search in raw&linked data

EdbSegP::eVid[0] - view entry in views tree (as before)
EdbSegP::eVid[1] - segment entry in view (as before)

EdbSegP::eAid[0] - areaID (== fragment)
EdbSegP::eAid[1] - viewID in the area

For the fast finding of the segment by AreaId, ViewID and SegID could be
used the function:

int EdbDataPiece::GetLinkedSegEntr(int side,int aid, int vid, int sid,
TArrayI &entr);
  where side is 1 or 2
  entr is the output array of entries for this segment in the couples tree

  the return value is number of entries found for this segment

script tb.C illustrate the usage of this function

other (different approach) example is traceback.C

link&align algorithm wich works in a case of deltaZ=0. For the moment it is a kind
of hack - I plan to polish all stuff concerning chi2 calculation in a nearest
future.

In new version of convertor (based on the new SysalDataIO) the eAreaID is 
started from 1 instead of 0. 

Schema evolution problems: eElements branch was commented out by 
the //! in EdbSegment.h. Seems not back-compatible - the data should 
be reconverted. The old data is readable anyway with no loading 
libraries, but if new version of libraries are loaded them give segfault 
(Views->Draw("eAreaID*121"))
