Terminology convention:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Frame - one CCD image

View - consists of many Frames with different Z,  XY size of View = Frame

Area  - consists of many Views

Run   - one session of scanning. Different runs could have different
        system tuning & calibration parameters. For each run results are stored
	in the correspondent root file.


General structure of Run file:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- RunHeader    - single object:  stored at run starting
- SysPar       - single object:  stored at run starting
- TransPar     - single object:  stored at run starting
- Predictions  - array of prediction tracks: stored at run starting
- Views	       - Root tree of View objects: stored per each view


Classes list: (Edb is prefics for all Emulsion DataBase classes)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* EdbRun	  -  main run class contained all objects
* EdbRunHeader	  -  RunID, PlateID, DateTime, Comment
*  -> EdbCamera      -  CCD camera specification
*  -> EdbPlate       -  emulsion plate specification
*  -> EdbPlateSet    -  emulsion settings specific for current run

  EdbSysPar	  - Scanning system configuration parameters (config.sys) 
  EdbTransPar	  - Coordinate transformation parameters ($a $b)

* EdbImage	  - Container for 1 image in bitmap format
* EdbFrame	  - Image + additional (positional) information

* EdbCluster	  - single cluster
  EdbSegment	  - track segment (can keep pointer on array od clusters)
  EdbTrack	  - single track  (can keep pointer on array of segments)

* EdbView	  - array of Frames
		    array of clusters
		    array of segments
		    array of tracks
* EdbViewHeader	  - view specific information


  EdbPredTrack	  - Predicted track (probably the same as Track)


Coding convention:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Class: prefix Edb              ( EdbClass )
Class data member: prefix e    ( eMember )  - to distinguish it from Root system members
Access member functions: prefix Get (GetMember)
